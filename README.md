What we propose: Personalized Recommendation System
The project focuses on developing and analyzing a Personalized Recommendation 
System, a technology widely used in industries like e-commerce, streaming services, and digital 
advertising. This system uses data analytics, machine learning, and user behavior tracking to 
recommend products, content, or services personalized to individual user preferences. The 
project will explore the use of such systems, the algorithms behind personalized 
recommendations, and their practical applications in various industries. The project will create a 
demo showcasing how the recommendation system works, providing personalized suggestions 
based on user data.
Project Objectives:
1. Develop a Functional Prototype: Create a working model of a Personalized 
Recommendation System that can generate recommendations based on user data inputs.
2. Analyze System Performance: Evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of the 
recommendations generated by the system through testing and analysis.
3. Explore Industry Applications: Demonstrate how personalized recommendation 
systems are utilized in different industries and discuss their impact on user engagement 
and business outcomes.
Deliverables:
1. Personalized Recommendation System Prototype: A functional prototype that can take
user data and generate personalized recommendations, showcased during the project 
demo.
2. Analytical Report: A report detailing the algorithms used, the systemâ€™s performance 
metrics, and a comparative analysis with existing recommendation systems.
3. Project Demo: A live or recorded demonstration of the Personalized Recommendation 
System, including how it processes data and generates recommendations, with examples 
from relevant industries such as e-commerce or stream service.
